#Machine_project 
This machine learning project focuses on predicting customer churn in a telecommunications company using customer-related data. The goal is to identify customers who are likely to cancel their subscription so the company can take preventive actions.

Key Steps:

Data Preparation & Cleaning:
The dataset was carefully prepared and cleaned. Missing values were handled appropriately to ensure data quality and model reliability.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Analytical charts and visualizations were used to explore patterns and relationships within the data. This helped in understanding key factors that influence customer churn.

Model Building:
Several machine learning algorithms were applied and compared, including:

Logistic Regression

Random Forest

XGBoost



These models were trained on relevant features such as customer demographics, service usage, and contract details to predict churn with high accuracy.
